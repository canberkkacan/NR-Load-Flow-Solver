# NR-Load-Flow-Solver
The Newton Raphson Load Flow Solver for IEEE CDF System


In the operation of electrical power systems, load flow analysis is a fundamental analysis for 
ensuring the safe operation and planning of power networks. The Newton-Raphson Load 
Flow Analysis is a widely utilized method due to its ease of convergence and robustness in 
handling non-linear equations. This project aims to develop a generic Python function 
capable of performing Newton-Raphson Load Flow Analysis while incorporating generator 
reactive power limit considerations. The implementation takes place in Python 3.12 
environment and is designed to be adaptable to various power systems that are presented in 
a common IEEE data format, such as the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems. Moreover, by 
considering the reactive power limits of generators, the function ensures a more realistic and 
accurate representation of the power network's operating conditions.
